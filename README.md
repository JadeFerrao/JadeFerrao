A Tech-Savvy AI/ML Enthusiast and Computer Science Graduate Fueling🚀 Innovation through Cutting-Edge Solutions.
 
I'm a highly motivated and intellectually curious individual who's always up for a challenge. With my proactive and ambitious approach towards problem-solving, I'm always on the lookout for ways to make a positive impact on society using my passion for AI/XR/R&D 💡.

🌱 I believe in personal growth and development, which is why I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and understanding of various fields beyond just sciences 📚. And when it comes to connecting with people, I love to learn from individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences - it's the best way to grow both personally and professionally 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

🏞️ When I'm not busy with work or personal development, I like to indulge in outdoor activities such as traveling ✈️ and exploring nature 🌲, or enriching myself with cultural experiences like reading books 📖, watching movies 🍿, and even learning new languages 🌎.

🔭 I’m currently working on projects that im very keen on learning like AI/ML tools.  I’m currently learning frontend and ML tools like spline,webflow,figma,jupyter,flask,panda,django,mysql. 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on various projects once given the chance as i love building new projects, working on them and learning new technologies🚀.
